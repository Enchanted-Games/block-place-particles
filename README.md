# Particle Interactions
A mod that adds particles to more interactions in the game, such as when placing a block or stripping a log. The mod aims to be as configurable as possible and doesn't need to be installed on the server!

This mod is fully client side, however, a few particles added by the mod won't spawn when other players use items, place blocks, etc. Better multiplayer support is planned in the future, which may require the mod to be installed server-side

All particles added by the mod can be adjusted or disabled entirely in the mods' config menu! To access this, click the Mods button on the title or pause screen (on Fabric you need [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)), click on the Particle Interactions mod, and click the config button

## This mod is in beta!
Some things may be changed or removed entirely before the full release. The config may break between versions before the full release. If you spot bugs / crashes, please [open an issue!](https://github.com/Enchanted-Games/block-place-particles/issues)
